    <div class="col-md-8 order-md-2">
	<p class="p-4">
	    Our story began at a STEM Club meeting where the idea of creating a
	    platform to rate male movie actors was thrown around. By the end of the meeting,
	    GRT chants excited the room full of nerds. Subsequently, we registered our domain
	    and made the name official, <strong><em>Guys Rate Things</em></strong>. To establish our mission
	    lets disect the name: <strong>Guys</strong> &#8212; Now you may ask why is this website exclusive
	    to only men &#8212; we <em>aren't</em>. According to the
	    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/07/07/guys-defense-gendered-etymology/" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>,
	    "Guys" is a casual, non-gendered term. We wanted to create community open to all
	    and not have a gender limiting and exclusive name. <strong>Rate</strong> &#8212; We plan to
	    establish a free-speech community were all opinions are debated, yet tolerated.
	    Lastly, <strong>Things</strong> &#8212; Display your opinions on anything from  cheese to shoes. Guys
	    Rate Things is a list forum for all to enjoy. Please support us  by sharing this website with your friends and family.

	<p class="lead">Nikolas Gianulis is a senior at Palmer Trinity School. Part Puerto Rican, Greek, and Mexican, Gianulis is not afraid to mix things around in his life. Nikolas is a fan of all things STEM, especially physics and engineering. Despite knowing several programming languages, Gianulis does not plan on studying Computer Science in college because “there are people like Carlos who are”. The second in command in the GRT Ladder, Gianulis just can’t wait until Carlos “Zuckerbergs” him. All jokes aside, Gianulis believes in the GRT philosophy that anyone and everyone can be a guy.</p>
